# Introduction

Cardinal Components API (A.K.A CCA) is a JavaScript library that helps people with making logic-required components. It works by providing basic JavaScript for components, then letting users reference the classes.

It essentially allows users to focus on designing their components, while not worrying too much about the logic.

## Philosophy

"Logic belongs in the modern web world, but it shouldn't be a pain in the rear end to code". is CCA's philosophy. It does the heavy lifting for you, **technically** meaning you only need to know HTMl and CSS with this library.
