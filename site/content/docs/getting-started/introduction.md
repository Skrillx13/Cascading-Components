# Introduction

Cardinal Components API (A.K.A CCA) is a JavaScript library that helps people with making logic-required components. It works by providing basic JavaScript for components, then letting users reference the classes.

It essentially allows users to focus on designing their components, while not worrying too much about the logic.

## Philosophy

"Logic belongs in the modern web world, but it shouldn't be a pain in the rear end to code". is CCA's philosophy. It does the heavy lifting for you, **technically** meaning you only need to know HTML and CSS with this library. JavaScript knowledge is still recommended though.

## Why use CCA?

"There's like a billion solutions to this issue out there? Why use your piece of software?" I hear you. The initial reason this was created was for the Primer project. Over time, it started gaining for traction till I decided to make it it's own thing, which is what now seperates it from Primer.

The whole point of CCA is to provide customizability. I seperated it from Primer because it was gaining traction, and I wanted it to be something unique, now just an add-on for another project.

## Key Features

- Customizable. You build your own components, allowing for creative freedom. Need to modify our JavaScript? No problem! Overrides are always available.
- Lightweight. Our Compiled & Bundled JavaScript weights in at about 8KB, which is impressive for a JavaScript library.
- Easy-to-use. CCA prides itself on simplicity, requiring minimal effort from the user.
- Scaleable. CCA can cater to really big and interactive components.
